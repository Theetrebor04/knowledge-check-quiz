## OVERVIEW

We were given the task to create an online quiz using:
* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML

## My Project
I started with HTML & CSS to create my box that would hold my Questions and Answers. I was able to 
get the Start Button to function and the questions to pop up one after another. The next button only 
populates after an answer was chosen. The display will also show you which answer is right and which 
are wrong. A timer starts when the quiz starts. If the time runs out before your done, you will get an 
alert stating you ran out of time and to try again. At the end of questions your score will show and 
give you the option to play again.
